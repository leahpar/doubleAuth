doubleAuth
==========

A quick-and-dirty Symfony 2.7 project as an exercise to test double password authentication.

Not yet working...

## UserProvider

This provider let me use hard-coded users (don't want to use Doctrine in this exercise).

see : http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/security/custom_provider.html

## AuthProvider

This is the main goal of this exercise
